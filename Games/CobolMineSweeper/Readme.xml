    <description>
	COBOL Minesweeper is a logic game in which you need to clear a minefield without detonating a mine. The minefield is a grid of undistinguished squares some of which contain mines. You click the squares to uncover them. If a square contains a mine, the game is over. Otherwise it shows the numbers of mines that are in the squares directly adjacent to that square. If the grid or the numbers are not displayed properly, check the Console Window Properties. Ensure the font in the console is set to "Lucida Console" and that the values on the Layout tab match the ones in the Defaults. Check the regional settings on your machine and ensure "Current language for non-Unicode programs" is set to "English".
